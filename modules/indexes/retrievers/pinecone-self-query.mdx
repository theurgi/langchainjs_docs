# Self Query Pinecone Retriever

The Self Query Retriever, which as the name suggests, has the ability to query itself. Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to it's underlying vector store. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents, but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filter.

This example uses Pinecone vector store.

## Usage

This example shows how to intialize a `SelfQueryRetriever` with a vector store:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/retrievers/pinecone_self_query.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
